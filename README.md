# Answer the questions
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]] 
- Can this sequence be considered correct? <br>
No
- If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct? <br>
 There is one open bracket and no closing bracket. But there is one closing square bracket with no opening one. So, to make this sequence correct we need to change first closing "]" to ")"<br>
 And the correct sequence is: [((())()(()))]
